# Wayfinder

Wayfinder is a React Native app mainly built for Android devices. It is the result of the collaborative efforts of @christianceb and @el-wisnugiri as a project prior to their graduation in NMTAFE.

Wayfinder is a mobile application that caters to North Metropolitan TAFE's requirements as a navigation app for students, teachers and guests. The app itself utilises Mapbox for the mapping services, a closed-source Laravel 7 backend for the datasets limited to the school and React Native itself.

Wayfinder has been released to the public on the 14th of January 2021 under the MIT License. As of writing, the project is much treated as abandoned. All API keys and URLs in the code have been deactivated and you will have to supply them yourself.
